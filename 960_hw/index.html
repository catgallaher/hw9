			<p>The main function of a leaf is to produce food for the plant by photosynthesis. Chlorophyll, the substance that gives plants their characteristic green colour, absorbs light energy. The internal structure of the leaf is protected by the leaf epidermis, which is continuous with the stem epidermis. The central leaf, or mesophyll, consists of soft-walled, unspecialized cells of the type known as parenchyma. As much as one-fifth of the mesophyll is composed of chlorophyll-containing chloroplasts, which absorb sunlight and, in conjunction with certain enzymes, use the radiant energy in decomposing water into its elements, hydrogen and oxygen.</p>

			<p>Many desert plants, such as Lithops and aloe, develop succulent leaves for water storage. The most common form of storage leaves are the succulent leaf bases of underground bulbs (e.g., tulip and Crocus) that serve as either water- or food-storage organs or both. Many nonparasitic plants that grow on the surfaces of other plants (epiphytes), such as some of the bromeliads, absorb water through specialized hairs on the surfaces of their leaves. In the water hyacinth (Eichhornia crassipes), swollen petioles keep the plant afloat.</p>

			<p><b><u>Elder</u></b> can be used in many ways. Firstly, the flowers are edible and make good fritters. Secondly, the flowers make a good soft drink. Take 12 flower heads and add to 2kg sugar and 500ml vinegar in 10 litres of water. Keep in a warm place and wait a few days. And finally, the fruits produce a good jam, juice or wine.
			<p>The leaves consist of 5-7 leaflets, in pairs with a single end leaflet. Each leaflet is elliptical with regular teeth and a pointed tip. The top of the leaflets is dark green and matt. The underside is paler.</p>

			<p><b>Wild cherry</b> is not a particularly frequent tree in Northern Ireland, although it and other forms of cherry have been planted for many years for ornamental reasons.

Often found on the edge of woodlands on alkaline soil, wild cherry can form a sizeable tree. Here it is at the edge of its natural distribution and tends to remain relatively small. In warmer European countries it may make quite a large tree and is widely grown for timber.</p>

			<p><b>Rowan </b>berries are relished especially by thrushes and other bigger songbirds. One bird that is very fond of them is the waxwing (Bombycilla garrulus). Aucuparia means “bird-catching”. Rowan was used in the past to create birdlime used in the unfortunate practise of trapping songbirds for food.</p>

			<p>The American <b>sycamore </b>has several other common names: American planetree, buttonwood, buttonball, and buttonball-tree. This tree is fast-growing and thrives in the lowlands and old fields in the Eastern Deciduous Forest. It can grow to heights between 75 and 100 feet and is capable of reaching 175 feet under the proper growing conditions.</p>
